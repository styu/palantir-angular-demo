Palantir Intro to AngularJS Demo
================================

Angular JS (https://angularjs.org/) is a powerful MVC web framework that lets you build dynamic web applications without having to worry too much about the inner workings of hooking up your models/variables with the actual elements on the page.

This repository contains the demo given at the 2016 MIT 6.148 Lecture. In this demo, we build a simple application that lets you play tic-tac-toe, all built in Angular. It introduces the concept of directives and controllers, as well as a brief introduction to using LESS instead of CSS.

If you would like to see a step by step, check out the different branches of this repository (starting at step1) to show what was done first.
