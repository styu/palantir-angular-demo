Palantir Intro to AngularJS Demo
================================

Angular JS (https://angularjs.org/) is a powerful MVC web framework that lets you build dynamic web applications without having to worry too much about the inner workings of hooking up your models/variables with the actual elements on the page.

This repository contains the demo given at the 2016 MIT 6.148 Lecture. In this demo, we build a simple application that lets you play tic-tac-toe, all built in Angular. It introduces the concept of directives and controllers, as well as some simple angular expressions.

If you would like to see the major steps of building the application, check out the different branches (demo, demo-step2, demo-step3), and the master branch for the completed application.
